ToggleReplied Thunderbird / SeaMonkey add-on
============================================

Add-on for Thunderbird or SeaMonkey which allows the replied,
forwarded, and redirected flags on existing messages in Thunderbird
and SeaMonkey.

This version of this add-on is maintained by Jonathan Kamens. Email
questions and feedback to [jik@kamens.us](mailto:jik@kamens.us). You
may also email bug reports there, or [post them on
Github](https://github.com/jikamens/ToggleReplied/issues).

Thank you to Christian Eyrich, the original author of this add-on.
This version is a fork of his version whose only changes (thus far)
are to ensure compatibility with newer Thunderbird and SeaMonkey
versions.
